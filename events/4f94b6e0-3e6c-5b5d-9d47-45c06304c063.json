  "description": "Yes, yes. We all know fuzzing is a powerful tool to find bugs.\r\nFor user space software, this is so 2014. Fuzzing kernels, however, can still be a daunting task.\r\nThe state of the art kernel fuzzer, syzkaller, is somewhat complex to set up. \r\nSo many unhappy parsers in the kernel remain unfuzzed to this day!\r\nWhy can we not simply start fuzzing from some random breakpoint in the kernel, you ask?\r\nWell of course we can. Let's drop the whole thing into Unicorn Engine, a CPU emulator, and give it input.\r\nSimple as that.\r\nTo stay on the punny side of things, we shall call this method *unicorefuzz*.",
