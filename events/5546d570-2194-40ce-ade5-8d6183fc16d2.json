  "abstract": "One of the founders of the Fusion Festival who had sold all his records and equipment before he sailed around the world. Luckily, the person who stepped ashore after 2 years of travel was not an entirely different one, so he returned to the decks in order to make people scream while dancing. His energetic approach to house & dance music takes the floor as a storm, all arms in the air and sweat from the wall.",
