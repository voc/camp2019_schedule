  "description": "Kitspace.org and the 1-click BOM browser extension make open source hardware electronics more practical by letting people independently order components and printed circuit boards themselves. We are working hard on making it easier for creators to fully document their projects and for others to re-build them. This is an open source project itself and you can join our developer community [on GitHub](https://github.com/kitspace).",
