    "description": "Since the first \"beep\" from Sputnik, there have been many different artificial signals from satellites, capsules and space stations being send back to earth. These multitude of RF (and laser...) signals not only show how different mission requirements dictate the system design for different spacecrafts, but also chronicle advances in communication technology since the advent of the space age.\r\nSo get to know how to understand the languages spoken by Voyager, GPS and satellite TV, and learn basics of RF communication in the process!
