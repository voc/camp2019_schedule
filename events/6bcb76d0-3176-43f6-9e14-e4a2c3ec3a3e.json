  "description": "Less than two years ago, we set out to create a hacker-and makerspace in the rural countryside of Brandenburg, twenty something minutes north-west of camp, in Fuerstenberg/Havel. Dubbed \"Verstehbahnhof\", as it is located in the local (and still operating) trainstation, the space was setup as an open educational space for the up- and coming and a shared workshop and space for like-minded grown-ups. This project, by now, has grown into much more than that. And we think it is time for you to know about a few things.",
