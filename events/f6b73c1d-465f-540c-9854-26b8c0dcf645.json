  "description": "During this particular format of \"consultation hours\" you can find out the latest about the work of CADUS, be it in the Crisis Response Makerspace in Berlin or in humanitarian aid projects abroad. Take a look at the almost functioning prototype of the Life Sensor, an open source patient monitor, or simply pick up some flyers to stay in touch. And of course: ask all the questions you have! (about CADUS, at least).\r\nConsultation hours are held in German or English, depending on the need. Oh, and if you have an actual medical issue, please consult the medic team of the camp, the person doing the consultation hour is not actually a medic.",
