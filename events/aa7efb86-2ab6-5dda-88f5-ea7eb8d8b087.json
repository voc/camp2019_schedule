  "description": "Years ago with a friend, we realized working on well-known open-source projects such as Firefox is harder than it seems : you need to clone repositories (which can take a lot of time on a slow connection), set up dependencies and toolchains, compile for the first time, install optional tools to help you on your workflow...\r\nWe made https://janitor.technology to help newcomers and developers experiment, hack, work, submit patches to these projects and not worry about this stuff !",
